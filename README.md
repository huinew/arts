# Leetocode 100 day
 hi everyone, welcome to leetcode 100 day.

 At first this is a activity for those who join chenHao's reader club,members are expected to do these weekly, we called it **ARTS** :

- A -- Algorithm an Algorithm Problem  

- R -- Review read a technical article and review it.

- T -- Tip  the skill you've learned this week

- S -- Share  your experience in work,learning or sth else.


but when you start to do it ,you'll find the most difficult things is not writing it but about how to consist on it.

So, maybe we can just persist on finishing leetcode problem at first.

Keep on 100 day, may be is easier than getting a list on a year.
